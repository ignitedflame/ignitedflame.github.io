What happens in the Infinity Fire modality is that perfect source energies are being channeled through you (not me) in a process that allows the frequencies you are able to receive are tripled. This creates the most effecient and powerful energies that are perfect for you, right now! You will always receive the perfect energies with this modality because the energies will change with you as you ascend.&nbsp;</p></div>

What not only knows you best, but the perfect most effecient way to release or transmute your blocks? Your own higher self! I may be facilitating the energies, but your higher self is the one running the show. This ensures there is no violation of free will and you will always receive everything you need that is in your highest and greatest good!&nbsp;</span></p></div>

                <div class="lead"><p>Something I found ridiculous with every energy healing modality I had used up until this point, was you had to go back time after time just to work on the same block. Not only that, but a lot of the methods only release blocks ... they don't replace that energy with a higher frequency, that means the blocks can come back or you can grow new blocks in its place. That's a TON of money just to release a couple of blocks, that could come back! With Infinty Fire the energies run continuously - it could be days, weeks or months until it is finished. This mean you will NEVER have to have another healing for those specific blocks again.&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 lead"><p><strong>What exactly is Infinity Fire?</strong><br></p><p>There are two parts to releasing and permanently changing your internal energy. The first part is the mental and emotional aspects- these are the thinking and feeling parts of your conscious and subconscious belief systems. The second part is the energetic aspect, this is what controls your mental and emotional aspects of conscious and subconscious beliefs. 
</p><p>Systems like therapy and coaching only focus on the mental aspect of the conscious mind and don't have anything to do with the energetic aspect. These systems focus on using your conscious thoughts to change your belief patterns without removing the energy that causes those belief patterns. Here's the problem with that, through our conscious mind we are only aware of 5-10% of our actions and why we take those actions, so these systems leave out the entire energetic connections in your subconscious - that's 90-95% of our actions and energies that govern those actions going untreated. &nbsp;
</p><p>Using these types of systems it is often very difficult to maintain the consistency necessary to change your conscious belief patterns because the energy behind those beliefs is still there causing resistance. &nbsp;
</p><p>Hypnosis, on the other hand, focuses only on the belief patterns of the subconscious mind and doesn't do anything with the energetic aspect. The issue with that is our subconscious mind's belief patterns are run by the energetics! If you don't release the core energies - eventually the belief pattern will come back! 
</p><p>Let me give you an example. Right now, I am aware of 4 actions that prevent me from losing weight. That means there is an additional 36-76 belief systems in my subconscious mind preventing me from being healthy. That's a lot of energy that is going unreleased with the above techniques.
</p><p>Infinity Fire works <strong>continuously</strong> with your higher self to <em>permanently </em>release and replace the energy that is behind your belief patterns. This effectivly makes it much easier to <strong>actually change</strong> your thoughts and actions in the real world. It could be weeks where you changed a way you did something before you even notice! That is how amazing energy healing can be!</p></div>
