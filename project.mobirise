The first part is the mental and emotional aspects- these are the thinking and feeling parts of your conscious and subconscious belief systems. The second part is the energetic aspect, this is what controls your mental and emotional aspects of conscious and subconscious beliefs. \n</p><p>Systems like therapy and coaching only focus on the mental aspect of the conscious mind and don't have anything to do with the energetic aspect. These systems focus on using your conscious thoughts to change your belief patterns without removing the energy that causes those belief patterns. Here's the problem with that, through our conscious mind we are only aware of 5-10% of our actions and why we take those actions, so these systems leave out the entire energetic connections in your subconscious - that's 90-95% of our actions and energies that govern those actions going untreated. &nbsp;\n</p><p>Using these types of systems it is often very difficult to maintain the consistency necessary to change your conscious belief patterns because the energy behind those beliefs is still there causing resistance. &nbsp;\n</p><p>Hypnosis, on the other hand, focuses only on the belief patterns of the subconscious mind and doesn't do anything with the energetic aspect. The issue with that is our subconscious mind's belief patterns are run by the energetics! If you don't release the core energies - eventually the belief pattern will come back! \n</p><p>Let me give you an example. Right now, I am aware of 4 actions that prevent me from losing weight. That means there is an additional 36-76 belief systems in my subconscious mind preventing me from being healthy. That's a lot of energy that is going unreleased with the above techniques.\n</p><p>Infinity Fire works <b>continuously</b> with your higher self to <i>permanently </i>release and replace the energy that is behind your belief patterns. This effectivly makes it much easier to <b>actually change</b> your thoughts and actions in the real world. It could be weeks where you changed a way you did something before you even notice! That is how amazing energy releasing can be!</p>",
